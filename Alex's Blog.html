        <p> I visited a lounge recently, I saw a collection of wall clocks of famous watch brands like Rolex . I imagined if I were to have a clock that matches my desk, this would be it </p>

        <p> Whenever I'm driving and I can't decide what music I want on the radio, this album is one of the first that comes to mind. Some songs I'd suggest are:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Ready to Run</em></li>
                <li><em>Girl Almighty</em></li>
                <li><em>No Control</em></li>
                <li><em>Fireproof</em></li>
                <li><em>Stockholm Syndrom</em></li>
                <li><em>Change Your Ticket</em></li>
            </ul>

        <h2> <strong> Tokyo Kyojin (Giants) Vintage Inspired Ballcap </strong></h2>
        <br>
        <p> In an article I read from <em> The New Yorker</em> about hats, it looked at hats from the standpoint of being cool conversational pieces. I feel the same way when I look at this ballcap, which made out of wool.    </p>

        <p> There's a quote from Eminem where he says he "felt like shoes are like 90% of your outfit". That's something I believed once I spent the big boy bucks on Air Force One's "Light Ivory/Earth Brown". Now, I need a versitile shoe and this one fits the bill  </p>
